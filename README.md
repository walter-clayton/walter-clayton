### 🔧 What I'm Building

- 🧠 **Afitpilot** — AI-driven adaptive coaching system for competitive athletes.  
  Built to solve under-loading, rigid periodization, and slow feedback loops using human-in-the-loop LLMs and performance science.
- 🌍 **Akwanza** — A design movement rooted in Afro-spiritual aesthetics, nature, and timeless symbols.
- 🧪 Ongoing experiments with prompt templating, evaluation, and local LLMs (Nous-Hermes, DeepSeek, etc.) for resilient edge-case planning.

---

### 🎯 What I Care About

- High-stakes systems where mistakes matter (training, health, performance)
- Human-in-the-loop AI instead of blind autonomy
- Clear decision authority over vague “smart” automation
- Tools that challenge people instead of pacifying them

### ✍️ Writings

I write publicly about the real limits of AI systems, LLM tooling, and why most “AI coaching” products fail in practice.

### 📌 Where to Look First

- **afitpilot-core** — adaptive coaching logic & decision authority
- **llm-evals** — rejection-rate metrics, prompt testing, and output quality experiments
- **nuxt-ssr-labs** — performance and UX experiments in production Nuxt apps

### ⚡ Fun Facts

- Most of my ideas come while walking, training, or watering plants — not while coding.
- Duolingo Spanish streak: Day 200+ 🇪🇸 add me → walthedude
- Obsessive about clarity — but I still nap through existential dread.
